Sue, it worked!!

YAY!!!! We survived our first pull request and merge!!! Well done. Just think of the places we'll go... :-)

As you can tell from the name of this branch, naming can be a little nebulous -- I didn't want to call my branch bug/something because that would imply I was fixing something in your code, but there wasn't anything wrong so that felt rude! LOL But this README isn't a new feature, either, so feature/README doesn't make much sense. I dunno...it's not an exact science, and the names don't really have any significance beyond keeping the two of us organized together. We'll figure out what tags and branch names make sense to us.

Well done. :-)
